# Cross-linguistic-Comparison-of-Translated-Data

The code displayed in this repository is part of my experimentation with the multilingual data that comes from various translations of William Faulkner's *The Sound and the Fury*. I collected some datasets while writing my [PhD thesis](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/61485099/2016_Salciute_Civiliene_Gabrielle_0975961_ethesis.pdf) and afterwards, while other language-specific datasets were collected by various contributors credited on the website of [Distant Reading across Languages (DRaL)](https://dral.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/), the proof-of-concept project developed in partnership with [King's Digital Lab](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/our-work/distant-reading/).
